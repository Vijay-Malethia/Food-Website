        Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally
        enjoyable to humans. It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. ... Some people
        refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs, and products with milk in them.

        Originally, people got food as hunter-gatherers. The agricultural revolution changed that. Farmers grew crops
        including those invented and improved by selective breeding. [3] These improvements, for example the invention
        of maize, allowed feeding more people, and further improvements gave it a better taste.

        Food shortage has been a big problem throughout history. Many people do not have enough money to buy the food
        that they need. Bad weather or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world. When
        people do not have enough food, we say that they are hungry. If they do not eat enough food for a long time,
        they will become sick and die from starvation. In areas where many people do not have enough food, we say that
        there is famine there.

        It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is
        not always safe,
        because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this
        reason, there are several types of agriculture.

        Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.
        Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical
        fertilizers.
        Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure.
        Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in
        another process.

    <p class="fontstyle">
        This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical
        fertilizers, pesticides (chemicals that kill bugs), and herbicides (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals
        can pollute the soil or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals,
        causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by erosion (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or
        loss of structure. Irrigation (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These
        problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.
